# advent-of-code
Every year I complete the Advent of Code challenges - 25 programming problems that run from 01 Dec to 25 Dec. 

Submissions open at the same time globally, to enable competition for leaderboard spots. Many of these solutions were created within minutes of the 5am (GMT) opening time.

All submissions were originally created as quickly as possible in an attempt to hit the global leaderboard, so code quality is highly variable. I have, however, taken the time to refactor some of the more interesting challenges.
